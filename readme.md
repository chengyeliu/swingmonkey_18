## Overview
This project follows the description of the Deep Q Learning algorithm described in Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning [2] and shows that this learning algorithm can be further generalized to the notorious Flappy Bird.

## Installation Dependencies:
* Python 2.7 or 3
* TensorFlow 0.7
* pygame
* OpenCV-Python

## How to Run?
```
git clone https://github.com/yenchenlin1994/DeepLearningFlappyBird.git
cd DeepLearningFlappyBird
python deep_q_network.py
```
